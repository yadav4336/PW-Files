    "Method chaining is a technique where you call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code, one after the other. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (`self`) so that the next method can be called on the returned object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of method chaining:\n",
    "- **Improved Readability**: Makes code more concise and easier to read by avoiding the need for intermediate variables.\n",
    "- **Fluent Interface**: Creates a more natural and expressive way of interacting with objects.\n",
    "- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Avoids repeating the object name multiple times.\n"

    "In Python, the `__call__` method allows you to make an object callable like a function. When you define the `__call__` method in a class, you can then use instances of that class as if they were functions. This can be useful for creating objects that behave like functions or for encapsulating complex logic within an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "- **Make Objects Callable**: The primary purpose of the `__call__` method is to enable objects to be called like functions. This means you can use the object's name followed by parentheses to execute the code within the `__call__` method.\n",
    "- **Encapsulate Logic**: You can use the `__call__` method to encapsulate complex logic within an object, which can make your code more organized and easier to understand.\n",
    "- **Create Function-like Objects**: You can create objects that behave like functions by defining the `__call__` method. This can be useful for creating custom functions or for providing a more object-oriented way to represent functions.\n"
